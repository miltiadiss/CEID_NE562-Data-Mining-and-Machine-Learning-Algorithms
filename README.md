This project is part of **Data Mining & Learning Algorithms** course in Computer Engineering & Informatics Department of University of Patras for Spring Semester 2023-2024. 
* **Dataset**: [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/779/harth](URL) : The Human Activity Recognition Trondheim (HARTH) dataset contains recordings of 22 participants wearing two 3-axial Axivity AX3 accelerometers for around 2 hours in a free-living setting. One sensor was attached to the right front thigh and the other to the lower back. The provided sampling rate is 50Hz. 

    Each subject's recordings are provided in a separate .csv file. One such .csv file contains the following columns:
    1. **timestamp**: date and time of recorded sample
    2. **back_x**: acceleration of back sensor in x-direction (down) in the unit g
    3. **back_y**: acceleration of back sensor in y-direction (left) in the unit g
    4. **back_z**: acceleration of back sensor in z-direction (forward) in the unit g
    5. **thigh_x**: acceleration of thigh sensor in x-direction (down) in the unit g
    6. **thigh_y**: acceleration of thigh sensor in y-direction (right) in the unit g
    7. **thigh_z**: acceleration of thigh sensor in z-direction (backward) in the unit g
    8. **label**: annotated activity code

    The dataset contains the following annotated activities with the corresponding coding:
    1: **walking**	
    2: **running**	
    3: **shuffling**
    4: **stairs (ascending)**
    5: **stairs (descending)**	
    6: **standing**	
    7: **sitting**	
    8: **lying**	
    13: **cycling (sit)**	
    14: **cycling (stand)**	
    130: **cycling (sit, inactive)**
    140: **cycling (stand, inactive)**

* **Goals**: 1. Statistic study of the features of the dataset
             2. Implementation of
